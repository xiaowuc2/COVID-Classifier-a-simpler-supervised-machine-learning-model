### Abstract

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease causedby the SARS-CoV-2 virus.In most cases, it is the largest category for anRNA  virus.  Authorities  in  222  countries  and  territories  have  reportedabout  244.2  million  Covid-19  cases  and  5  million  deaths  since  Chinareported its first cases to the World Health Organization (WHO) in De-cember  2019.  Our  proposed  classifier  assists  in  the  early  diagnosis  of Covid-19. There are many well established model which can give moreaccurate results based on X-ray or CT scans, but they are convoluted andabstruse for normal person. We’ve developed a more simpler model with‘`Yes`’ and ‘`No`’ types  on  question,  where our huge dataset are trained with these features : ‘`BreathingProblem`’, ‘`Fever`’, ‘`Dry Cough`’, ‘`Sore throat`’, ‘`Running Nose`’, ‘`Asthma`’, ‘`Chronic  Lung  Disease`’, ‘`Headache`’, ‘`Heart  Disease`’, ‘`Diabetes`’, ‘`HyperTension`’, ‘`Fatigue`’ and eight more. Based on these data the model willpredict result in a probabilistic view.
